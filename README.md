# yolo-v3-object-detector

This repository contains the code to create and run a pretrained object
detection model named YOLOv3. the model is trained on the MSCOCO dataset.
The code is based pretty much in it's entirety on the GitHub repository
keras-yolo3 created by the user experiencor.

I made some minor additions needed in order to be able to run it in my computer.




###Instructions to use the model:

1. Download the pretrained weights to the model using the following link:
